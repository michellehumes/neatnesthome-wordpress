<strong>The Short Version:</strong> Some links on this site are affiliate links. If you click and buy something, we earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. We only recommend products we genuinely believe in.
</p>

<h2>Full Disclosure</h2>

<p>Neat Nest Home is a participant in the <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</p>

<p>This means that when you click on certain links on our website and make a purchase, we may receive a small commission from Amazon. This commission comes at <strong>no additional cost to you</strong>—the price you pay is the same whether you use our link or go directly to Amazon.</p>

<h2>Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>

<p>Running a website costs money—hosting, design, research time, and more. Affiliate commissions help us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the site running and ad-free (or with minimal ads)</li>
  <li>Spend time researching and comparing products</li>
  <li>Create detailed, helpful content for free</li>
  <li>Update old posts with current information</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Promise to You</h2>

  <div style="padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #5B8A72; background: #F8F6F3;">
    <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #5B8A72;">Honesty First</h4>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">We will never recommend a product just because it pays a higher commission. Our recommendations are based on research, reviews, and what we believe will genuinely help you.</p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #5B8A72;">Full Transparency</h4>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">We clearly disclose affiliate relationships. When a post contains affiliate links, you'll see a disclosure notice at the top of the article.</p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #5B8A72;">Balanced Reviews</h4>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">We include both pros AND cons in our reviews. No product is perfect, and we'll tell you the downsides so you can make an informed decision.</p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #5B8A72;">No Pay-for-Play</h4>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Companies cannot pay us to write positive reviews. While we occasionally receive products for review, our opinions are always our own and uninfluenced by free products.</p>

  <li>Are clearly labeled with buttons like "View on Amazon" or "Check Price"</li>
  <li>Appear in posts with a disclosure notice at the top</li>

  <li>Use a browser extension that removes affiliate tags</li>
</ul>

<p>We appreciate when you do use our links, as it supports our work at no cost to you, but we completely understand if you choose not to.</p>
