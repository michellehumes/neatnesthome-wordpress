      <strong>Hi, I'm [Your Name]</strong>, and I believe everyone deserves a home that works for them—not against them.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started Neat Nest Home after spending years living in small apartments, cramped rentals, and homes that never seemed to have enough storage. I was tired of Pinterest-perfect organizing content that required unlimited budgets and custom built-ins. I wanted real solutions for real spaces.
